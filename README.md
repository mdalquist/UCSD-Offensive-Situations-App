# UCSD-Offensive-Situations-App

This repository stores the app I built to help the baseball and softball coaches at UCSD make in-game strategy decisions by providing a chance of success needed to break even on expected runs or run probability. 

The app is hosted on streamlit at https://ucsd-offensive-situations-app-65pwgcrawzsdqpscpa39vg.streamlit.app/[https://ucsd-offensive-situations-app-65pwgcrawzsdqpscpa39vg.streamlit.app/]
